Installation
-------------
If you are using Windows, simplely clone&open it with Visual Studio  ([Free](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)) and you are ready to go.

For MacOS X and Linux, check out [Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono) compiler. Alternatively, you can compile the source code on Windows and deploy to MacOS X&Linux with simple command just like `mono hello.exe`, no recompile is required. 

A compiled demo is also included in the **demo** folder that can be executed directly on Windows or using **mono** runtime on Linux & Mac.
